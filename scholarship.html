<h1>SCHOLARSHIP AND FEES REIUMBURSEMENT</h1>
<p>
hether you are a talented athlete looking for a full-ride scholarship to your dream college or you are more of a club sport athlete looking to play at a more recreational level, there are scholarships for both types, and everyone in-between. Based on your sport, there may be more or less competition which will affect the amount of scholarship money and awards that can be disbursed. For high-visibility sports such as football or basketball, it may be harder to break into a program and land a full-ride scholarship. Even though college and universities are the most sought-out for athletic scholarships, there are organizations and businesses that reward student-athletes. Know your skill, worth, and do your research when looking into possible athletic scholarships.

Landing an athletic scholarship isn't all about being the best basketball player, wrestler or bowler on your high school team. There are many awards available for athletes who play not to make a career of a sport, but because they enjoy the game. Local leagues and organizations in sports like baseball and golf, for example, offer many scholarships just for playing on a team, no matter how good you are. Although it helps to be talented in a given area, don't be discouraged if you're not cut out for the lifestyle required to make yourself a marketable athlete at the top level of play. You don't even have to play on your college's team. Many rewards require an interest in a sport and the intention to continue playing it when you go to college, even it's on a club or intramural team. Since these scholarships tend to not be performance-based, other criteria such as financial need or proven academic success may be required instead.

Explore our examples of school-based and sports scholarships from outside organizations. Don't rule out academic scholarships when applying for funding, as you wonâ€™t be playing on the team if you can't pay the tuition.
